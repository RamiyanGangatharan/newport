### Instructions:
After unzipping the project folder, please use the following commands in your terminal to install and update all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

To run this code locally, use one of the following command options:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```
```bash
npm run dev
```

_Note: Both commands perform the same action; `npm run dev` is a shortcut for easier use._

# ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS
Make sure that Node.js and npm are installed on your machine. If theyâ€™re not, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website. This project uses Embedded JavaScript (`EJS`) and Express.js. Please note that once the server is running, changes made to the source files will not automatically reload in the browser. Manually refresh the browser (press `F5`) to see any updates.

# Strapi API Setup
This project includes a Strapi API setup, located in the `API` folder at the root level of the project, next to the `src` folder. To launch the Strapi API, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the API folder:
```bash
cd API
```

2. Install Strapi dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the Strapi development server:
