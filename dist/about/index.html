                <div class="double-column">
                    <p class="lead text-muted" ><p>My name is Ramiyan Gangatharan, and I am a Full-Stack Developer based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This website serves as my portfolio, showcasing a collection of various projects I have undertaken throughout my journey in post-secondary education and beyond. My primary goal is to highlight my skills and experiences while merging the diverse websites I have created into one cohesive platform. I have a deep appreciation for crafting intuitive and dynamic user experiences, whether for online or offline applications. In the realm of online development, I utilize Java Web Pages with Servlets and PostgreSQL, along with the MERN stack, enabling me to create complex full-stack web applications that leverage technologies such as MongoDB, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, HTML, and JavaScript. On the offline side, I explore video game development using the Unity Engine and Unreal Engine, as well as console text-based applications, applications with basic handmade computer vector graphics, and desktop applications on the .NET framework. I also enjoy developing mobile applications, which allows me to create engaging experiences for users on various devices. Additionally, I love designing applications with diagrams, as this visual approach enhances my ability to communicate ideas and concepts clearly.</p>
<p>My journey into the world of programming began with a year spent pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College, which provided me with foundational software development and team management skills. I then moved to Durham College, where I am currently in my fifth semester of a three-year Advanced Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis. During this time, I have developed a strong foundation in several programming languages, including C# and Java, as well as the MERN stack, which encompasses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. This educational background has not only equipped me with the technical skills necessary for development but has also instilled in me the importance of problem-solving and critical thinking. Following my diploma, I plan to pursue an advanced entry Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT), allowing me to deepen my understanding of computer science principles and stay updated with the latest technologies and trends.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, each enhancing my skills and broadening my knowledge. From building responsive websites that prioritize user experience to developing robust systems that handle data efficiently, I thrive on challenges and embrace continuous learning. My expertise lies in full-stack development, which allows me to tackle projects from conception to deployment. While I enjoy the versatility of working across the entire stack, my true passion lies in back-end development. I find great satisfaction in designing and optimizing databases, creating APIs, and ensuring that applications operate smoothly behind the scenes. Additionally, my experience in software engineering and development has equipped me to manage teams effectively, fostering collaboration to bring applications to life. Beyond my technical skills, I believe in the importance of collaboration and communication in the development process. I thrive in team environments where ideas can be shared freely, and creativity can flourish. My experiences have taught me the value of feedback and iteration, which are crucial for delivering high-quality products that meet user needs.</p>
<p>Outside of coding, I am an avid reader, gamer, and car enthusiast. I have a passion for exploring the latest automotive technologies and trends, whether it&#39;s following new car releases or building cars in Forza or BeamNG Drive in my spare time. Gaming also plays a significant role in my life, as I enjoy immersing myself in various video games, which often inspires my creative thinking and problem-solving skills. For example I love playing Red Dead Redemption 2, Forza Horizon 5, and Assetto Corsa. As a lifelong learner, I love exploring new technologies and staying updated with industry trends. In my free time, I contribute to various projects and collaborate with fellow developers to enhance my skills and share knowledge. As I look toward the future, I am excited about new opportunities that will challenge me and help me grow as a developer. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I welcome the chance to connect with you!</p>
